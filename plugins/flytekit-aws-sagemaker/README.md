# Flytekit AWS Sagemaker Plugin

Amazon SageMaker provides several built-in machine learning algorithms that you can use for a variety of problem types. Flyte Sagemaker plugin intends to greatly simplify using Sagemaker for training. We have tried to distill the API into a meaningful subset that makes it easier for users to adopt and run with Sagemaker.

To install the plugin, run the following command:

```bash
pip install flytekitplugins-awssagemaker
```
