# Flytekit InfluxDB Plugin

InfluxDB, coupled with the power of pandas, facilitates streamlined management and analysis of time-series data. 
By integrating the InfluxDB plugin with Flyte, you gain access to time-series data manipulation capabilities directly within your workflows. 
This plugin is tailored to interact with pandas DataFrames, allowing for creation, retrieval, and deletion of time-series data stored in InfluxDB. 

To install the plugin, run the following command:

```bash
pip install flytekitplugins-influxdb
```

To configure InfluxDB in the Flyte deployment's backend, follow the [configuration guide](none).
